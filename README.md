# BreatheSafe: Wildfire Smoke Risk Notifier

A lightweight tool to help users decide when to close their windows based on wildfire smoke and air quality forecasts.

## Overview

BreatheSafe is a small scale, data driven system that tracks wildfire smoke dispersion and PM2.5 forecasts to notify users of periods when ventilation may be harmful to health. It leverages Canada's FireWork model and GEO.ca open data to make environmental health awareness more personal, real-time, and actionable.

This project was developed as part of the GeoIgnite 2025 Hackathon: Building Resilience with GEO.ca.
